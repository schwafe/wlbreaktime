There are plenty of applications that remind you to take breaks, however there aren't many that can block the screen with a pop-up when a break has arrived and none that are Wayland-native, as far as I know. Additionally, the applications that I know of aren't very console-friendly.

There are still a lot of things I plan on supporting, some of them are:
 - proper packaging (no need for manual copying of files during installation)
 - loading a configuration and reloading on systemctl reload
 - playing a sound when the break is over
 - sending a notification a few seconds before a break starts
 - making the screen blocking optional (and provide an alternative)
