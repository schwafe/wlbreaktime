There are plenty of applications that remind you to take breaks, however there aren't many that can block the screen with a pop-up when a break has arrived and none that are Wayland-native, as far as I know. Additionally, the applications that I know of aren't very console-friendly.

There are still a lot of things I plan on supporting, some of them are:
 - proper packaging (no need for manual copying of files during installation)
 - enable reloading of the config on systemctl reload
 - think of an alternative for the screen blocking (maybe a smaller pop-up?)
 - implement tests
